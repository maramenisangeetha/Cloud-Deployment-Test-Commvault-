CODE STRUCTURE FOR CLOUD DEPLOYEMENT TASK

1. Create VPC and Subnet

In this step I have used AWS console to create a Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) and a subnet which I used for creating my EC2 instance.

2. Deploy EC2 instance and connect it to subnet.

Using the VPC and subnet created in previous method I created a Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) named instance_sangee and for that ec2 instance I created a IAM role through which I was able to estabilish connection with Amazon S3 Bucket.

3. Create S3 bucket and deploy static website

using the  python code I created my html hello world website

echo "<html><body>Hello World!</html></body> > index.html

in this way I created my html website

4. Installing nginx in EC2 instances

After connecting to the ec2 instance, I opened the terminal and initiated the following commands

~sudo yum updates
~cat /etc/os-release
~sudo vim/etc/yu.repos.d/nginx.repo
~sudo yum install nginx
~sudo service nginx start
~curl localhost:80 
~start nginx.service



->using these command I installed nginx in  EC2 instance and created the python code with public access
